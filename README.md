Looping Rings---SuperCollider Monome Arc + Grid

This is my first project where I will attempt to use the Github system to aid the development my Looping Rings patch for SuperCollider.

Looping Rings:

For each Arc encoder (four encoders total), there is a single note.

Each note is represented by a bar which cycles around the encoder. 
Increasing the volume increases the size of the bar.
Increasing the speed increases the rate the bar travels around the encoder.
